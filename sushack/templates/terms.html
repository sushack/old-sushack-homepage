  <p>2.2  At any time either Incuna or the Customer may suggest a change to the Services.  Such change will not be effective unless and until agreed in writing by the parties and may be subject to additional Charges which shall be reasonable in line with the existing Charges.</p>
  <p>2.3  Incuna, at its discretion, will co-operate with any other agencies appointed by the Customer during the provision of the Services, provided these agencies are not in competition with Incuna and that, where such agency was not identified to Incuna by the Effective Date and Incuna suffers additional cost as a result of co-operating with such agency, Incuna reserves the right to levy additional Charges which shall be reasonable in line with the existing Charges.</p>
  <p>2.4  Incuna will allocate a Project Manager as stated in the Order. Incuna shall keep the Customer informed of the progress of the Services on a regular basis as agreed with the Customer.</p>
  <p>2.5  Incuna will devote the efforts of suitably trained and qualified employees capable of carrying out the Services to a professional standard and shall provide all the necessary facilities therefore.</p>

  <p><br /> <strong> 3  CHARGES AND PAYMENT</strong></p>
  <p>3.1  The Charges for the Services are set out in the Order and will be confirmed by the Customer by signing and returning a copy of the Order.  Incuna will invoice the Customer as detailed in the Invoicing Schedule in the Order.  The Customer (subject to their rights detailed within the Conditions) shall remit payment in respect of each validly submitted invoice to Incuna within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.

Customer agrees that payments to Incuna for work completed will not be delayed for reasons of non-performance of or non-delivery by others</p>

  <p>3.3  The Customer shall not be required to pay invoices until satisfied that all details in the invoice are consistent with the Services satisfactorily provided.  Payment will not be deemed to be the Customers acceptance that the Services have been performed satisfactorily.</p>
  <p>3.4  If any valid and correct invoice that is not in dispute payable to Incuna by the Customer is not paid by the due date then (without prejudice to Incuna&rsquo;s other rights and remedies) Incuna may suspend the provision of any or all of the Services.</p>
  <p><br /> <strong> 4  DURATION</strong></p>

  <p>5.2  The Customer will where reasonably possible provide Incuna with all information, materials and documentation reasonably requested by Incuna to allow Incuna to provide the Services and the Deliverables.

Incuna shall submit any material to an authorised representative of the Customer in good time to enable approval to be given prior to any deadline for issue (such time detailed in the Order).  Such written approval shall be Incuna&rsquo;s authority to proceed with the dissemination of the appropriate Deliverables.  For the avoidance of doubt Incuna will not submit, publish, disseminate, distribute or otherwise any materials or information including the Deliverables without the prior written consent of the Customer.  Failure to do so will be considered a material breach of the Contract.</p>
  <p>5.3  The Customer will ensure that the Customer Material complies at all times with all applicable laws, advertising standards and codes of practice and the rules and regulations of any competent authority from time to time and that all the Customer Material is decent, honest and true.</p>

  <p><br /> <strong> 6  CUSTOMER MATERIAL</strong></p>
  <p>6.1  Despite anything else in the Contract, Incuna will not be obliged to do anything that, in its reasonable opinion, may infringe the Intellectual Property Rights or other rights of any third party.

  <p>8.2  The Intellectual Property Rights in all Deliverables, and in all ideas, methodologies, inventions, discoveries, designs, concepts and work arising from the Services, as between the Customer and Incuna, belong to Incuna.

  <p>10.1.2 by either party immediately on giving notice in writing to the other if the other commits any material breach of any term of the Contract, (other than any failure by the Customer to make any payment, in which case the provisions of condition 10.1.1 will apply) and (in the case of a breach which is capable of being remedied) has failed, within 28 days after the receipt of a request in writing so to do, to remedy the breach; or</p>
  <p>10.1.3 by either party immediately on giving notice in writing to the other if the other has a receiver or administrative receiver appointed of it or over any part of its undertaking or assets, or passes a resolution for winding-up (other than for the purposes of a bona fide scheme of solvent amalgamation or reconstruction), or if a court of competent jurisdiction makes an order to that effect, or if the other party becomes subject to an administration order or enters into any voluntary arrangement with its creditors, or if any similar process to any of the above is begun, or if the other party ceases or threatens to cease to carry on its business.</p>
  <p>10.2 Any termination or expiry of the Contract (however it happens) will not affect any accrued rights or liabilities of either party.

  <p><br /> <strong> 11 DELAYS</strong></p>
  <p>11.1 Despite anything else contained in the Contract, neither party will be liable for any delay or failure in performing its obligations under the Contract if that delay or failure is caused by circumstances beyond its control (including, without limitation, any delay caused by any act or omission of the other party or any third party), and the party so delaying will be entitled to a reasonable extension of time for the performance of its obligations.</p>
